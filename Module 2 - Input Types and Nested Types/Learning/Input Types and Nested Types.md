# Module 2: Input Types & Nested Types

## ðŸ§  Learning

### ðŸ“Œ What Are Input Types?

In GraphQL, `type` is used for **output** (things the client asks for).  
But when **sending data into** the API â€” like during a `mutation` â€” we use **`input` types**.

> `input` is a special kind of type used to define the structure of arguments.

#### âœ… Example:

```graphql
input SkillInput {
  title: String!
  status: String
}
```

you can now use `SkillInput` like this:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  addSkill(input: SkillInput!): Skill
}
```

inside the resolver, you'll access it like this:

```js
addSkill: async (_, { input }) => {
  const { title, status } = input;
};
```

## What are Nested Types?

You can nest custom types inside other types.

Lets say a `User` can have many `Skills`.

```graphql
type Skill {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  status: String
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
  skills: [Skill]
}
```

this means a query like this becomes possible:

```graphql
query {
  getUser(id: "123") {
    name
    skills {
      title
      status
    }
  }
}
```

## Why Use Inputs & Nesting?

- Inputs keep your mutations args clean and scalable
- Nested types allow expressive queries that deeply represent your data relationships
- Helps with validation, structure, and clarity when your schema grows

## Summary

| Concept           | Purpose                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `input`           | Defines arguments for mutations  |
| Nested Types      | Embeds one type inside another   |
| `[Type]`          | A list of types                  |
| `input SomeInput` | Cannot have methods, only fields |
