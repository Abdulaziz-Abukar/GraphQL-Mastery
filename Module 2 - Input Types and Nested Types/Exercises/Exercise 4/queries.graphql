# Task 1: Use Aliases
# Let's say you want to get the same skill twice, but labeled differently.
query {
  firstSkill: getSkill(id: "ID_1") {
    title
    status
  }
  secondSkill: getSkill(id: "ID_2") {
    title
    status
  }
}

# Task 2: Use Fragments
# Instead of repeating fields like title and status, you can define them once:
query {
  getAllSkills {
    ...SkillFields
  }
}

fragment SkillFields on Skill {
  title
  status
}
