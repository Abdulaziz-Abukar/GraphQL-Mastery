# ðŸ§ª Exercise 2: Create a Query Using MongoDB + Mongoose

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal:

Replace your dummy skill data with **real MongoDB data** using **Mongoose**. Youâ€™ll:

- Connect to a MongoDB database
- Define a `Skill` model
- Update your resolvers to use actual database queries

## ðŸ“¦ What Youâ€™ll Build

Youâ€™ll upgrade your GraphQL API to:

- Fetch all skills from a MongoDB collection
- Fetch a single skill by ID from the database
